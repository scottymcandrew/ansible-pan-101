# Provider is a slightly newer way of speciftying connection info for a NGFW
# Prior we'd need to set IP, user, pass (etc) in separate lines in each playbook task
# This way we simply set "provider: {{ provider }}".
# Name 'provider' corresponds to the name below, it could just as easily be called "letmeonthisfirewall"
provider:
  ip_address: '192.168.55.10'
  username: 'admin'
  password: 'Paloalto1!'

# If you are using a virtualenv, then update to e.g. "./env/bin/python3"
